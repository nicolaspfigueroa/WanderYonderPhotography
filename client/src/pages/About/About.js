      <p className = "text">My name is Austin Bennett. I am a landscape photographer originally from Louisiana. 
      Upon moving to the west I was inspired by the incredible wilderness scenes that the mountain and desert held, 
      and began using every spare moment to capture them. In that process I have travelled to over 50 national parks 
      in the United States, climbed all 58 14,000 foot peaks in Colorado (and several more besides), and witnessed some 
      of the most moving moments that nature has to offer. If I'm not working my day job as a nurse, you can be 
      sure I am in the outdoors chasing light and getting too little sleep! I shoot on a Canon R6, Canon RF 15-35mm f2.8, 
      Canon RF 24-105mm f4, Canon RF 100-500mm, and DJI Mavic 3. Email me if you have any inquiries!
